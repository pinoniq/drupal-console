Drupal Console based on the work of https://github.com/hechoendrupal/drupal-console
=============================================

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/pinoniq/drupal-console/v)](//packagist.org/packages/pinoniq/drupal-console) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/pinoniq/drupal-console/downloads)](//packagist.org/packages/pinoniq/drupal-console) [![Latest Unstable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/pinoniq/drupal-console/v/unstable)](//packagist.org/packages/pinoniq/drupal-console) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/pinoniq/drupal-console/license)](//packagist.org/packages/pinoniq/drupal-console)

The Drupal CLI. A tool to generate boilerplate code, interact with and debug Drupal.

This is a fork of https://github.com/hechoendrupal/drupal-console and all the intial credits go to them.

I created this fork due to inactivity on the original project. Moving forward, the main focus will be to support Drupal 9 and php 7.4+

It might work on older version, but at this point without any guarantee.
